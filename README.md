My first GitHub repository

Hi Everyone!
Mostly i like Java, but I was writing couple of projects in another programing languages(e.g. C, C++).
Also I like solve problems, read blogs, articles, documentation and other sources to get solution. Search websites, read users blogs, posts and other, to run something - great for me!
